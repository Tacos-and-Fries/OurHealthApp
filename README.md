# OurHealthApp

OurHealthApp was created to help users in adhering to their health care regimes, which may involve keeping track of their medications, appointments, and other related details. It also has the option to upload a prescription to the app, making their lives easier.

This application was built with Python tkinter, SQL and Firebase cloud storage.

The features include:

1. Add general reminders

2. Add appointment reminders

3. Upload a prescription and access it from anywhere with the link provided.

(The reminders and appointments are arranged in ‘first-due-date-first’ order and are displayed accordingly, and expired reminders/appointments are filtered out)

The above said features are connected with a SQL database and work dynamically with addition and deletion of any reminders/appointments or prescriptions.
